I developed this platform for a client who eventually _dropped me off_ (long story), so I decided to turn it into my final year project (known as a _TFG_ in Spain).

The company specialized in store construction and wanted to migrate all their spreadsheets into an easy-to-use platform. I studied their workflow in depth and identified several ways to optimize processes and save time.
